    <p>
      Renew is a Java-based multi-formalism editor and simulator that provides a flexible modeling approach based on, but not limited to, reference nets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petri nets are a well established means to describe concurrent systems. Over the years, numerous extensions to the basic formalism have been proposed to account for abstract data types, object-orientation, hierarchies or new arc types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them is the reference nets formalism, where tokens can be references to arbitrary objects, especially other nets, thus allowing nested net models. It allows Java inscriptions, has built-in List and Tuple types, offers test, inhibitor and flexible arcs and has a powerful synchronization mechanism.
